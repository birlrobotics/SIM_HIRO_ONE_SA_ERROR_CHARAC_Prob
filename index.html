        <p>Data from snap assembly work in simulation with the HIRO Robot. In particular this package is focusing on the analysis of failure trials, where different trials have been set to include a deviation in 1-3 directions and with different magnitudes. A probabilistic scheme is used to classify the failure type. Location: Guangzhou. Date: 2014.</p>

        <p>Data from snap assembly work in simulation with the HIRO Robot. In particular this package is focusing on the analysis of failure trials, where different trials have been set to include a deviation in 1-3 directions and with different magnitudes. A probabilistic scheme is used to classify the failure type. Location: Guangzhou. Date: 2014.</p>

<p>There are two sets of data that capture failure: exp##_sereis and the FC###_series. The exp series was used for ICRA 2014 and the FC series was used in humanoids. Each folder name has a sequence number followed by the deviation direction and amount. For example, "exp1+x0.0080-z0.005" indicates the 1st experiment, with a deviation of 0.008m in the x-direction and -0.005m in the z-direction. Note: the z-direction is not considered in the experimentation, it is modified to ensure we can still make contact between parts. The deviations we analyize are combinations of the following: delx, dely, delYall. Note: Humanoids uses the (appropriate) term Yall. In the ICRA data, we used the erroneous term Roll.</p>

<p>Also in the exp series there is an "R" term in the folder name, this is a parameter used in the OpenHRP DyanmicsSimulator that modifies contact/penetration dynamics between objects.</p>
